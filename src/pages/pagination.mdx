# Pagination

In this guide, we will look at how to work with paginated responses when querying the products endpoint of the ALX e-commerce app. By default, all responses limit results to ten products. However, you can go as high as 100 by adding a `limit` parameter to your requests. If you are using one of the client libraries, pagination is handled automatically. {{ className: 'lead' }}

When an API response returns a list of products, no matter the amount, pagination is supported. In paginated responses, products are nested in a `data` attribute and have a `has_more` attribute that indicates whether you have reached the end of the last page. You can use the `starting_after` and `ending_before` query parameters to browse pages.

## Example using cursors

<Row>
  <Col>

    In this example, we request the page that starts after the product with id `prod12345`. As a result, we get a list of three products and can tell by the `has_more` attribute that we have reached the end of the result set.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="starting_after" type="string">
        The last ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the next page.
      </Property>
      <Property name="ending_before" type="string">
        The first ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the previous page.
      </Property>
      <Property name="limit" type="integer">
        Limit the number of items returned.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
